# xRobbery
Another bukkit plugin. xRobbery is about robbing(woah!) - mafia vs. police.
# Using
To use this plugin you should install WorldGuard(+WorldEdit) and Vault.

Mafia and police are just 2 permission nodes that you should give to players.

xrob.mafia - mafia members; xrob.police - policemen.

After this you should select leader by /rob leader <nick> or in configuration file.

Location of teleportations can be changed(and should be changed for a first time) by /rob setloc m and /rob setloc p commands.

Bank region can be changed by using /rob setrg <region> command.
